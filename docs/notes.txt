-- Cool, semantically that works, but how does this affect
-- reuse and variable binding?
-- Values are now associated with a context comprised of TWO time streams: static time and dynamic time
-- Static time is the time of the scope where the was value declared.
-- Dynamic time is the time of the scope where the value is being used.
-- Thus when a value is constructed it is can be stored as such:
-- coolPattern 1: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
-- coolPattern 2: [(0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7)]
-- The semantics are still pure as multiple accesses to the same stream within the same context
-- always provide the same result

-- Ok, but does that work with feedback:

-- New idea:
-- Use Monad to enforce current value, everything else is a pure lazy stream.
-- No need for keeping track of "Contexts" or clocks
-- Needs garbage collection, but naturally handles feed back, cycles, and "current" values
-- Prevents top level "current" computations
-- Resolves ambiguity of "current" value times (value is from the time at which it was bound)
-- Enforces purity (the current value is bound to a single value which can be shared).
-- Don't need to record entire history of inputs
-- Feeback can still cause large thunk chains, but I think this is fine and akin to needing to understand that foldr can blow up on infinite lists
-- Need to check against global time of cached value in thunk?!?!?!!?

-- With Stream semantics the state monad does not work how one might hope
-- Each time through the loop of this action doubleTime is re-made, thus doubleTime and countUp start anew with no state saved in their networks
-- You could make writing type actions like setX keep going until their input networks stop, but this essentially takes over control of the entire program
-- This tension with history (a comonadic concept) and monads seems to be fundamental

"The pattern !cap bound by let marks cap
 as an “imperative variable,” which means
 that within its scope, functions applied to
 cap are expected to return a pair of their
 real result and the new version of cap.
 Alms transforms this code into the explicitly-threaded
 version above. Currently this transformation
 happens before type checking, which means that it
 cannot compromise soundness but also cannot exploit type in-
 formation."
